"Sex, Lies, and Sugar","Steve Balderson's movie, ""Sex, Lies, and Sugar"" focuses on a group of 1960's era suburban housewives.

They begin a recipe club, holding dinner parties, testing out their new casseroles. But when the gatherings become increasingly boozy and flirtatious, more than recipes start getting swapped. The story moves from stylized and campy to a drama about irresponsibility, selfishness, and damaged people.

To Kill a Tiger,"In a small village in Jharkhand, India, Ranjit wakes up to find that his 13-year-old daughter has not returned home from a family wedding. Calls are made, a search ensues, and a few hours later, she's found stumbling home. After having been dragged into the woods, she was sexually assaulted by three men, all of whom are known to the family. Ranjit and his wife go to the police, and the men are arrested. But the family's relief is short-lived when the villagers and their leaders launch a sustained campaign to force Ranjit to drop the charges. They demand the girl marry one of her rapists-a tried and true community solution. This, they feel, is the only way to restore her honour and that of the community. Ranjit defies their edict and embarks on a perilous journey, navigating both the labyrinth of India's courts and the rising dangers in his village. A cinematic, story-driven documentary, To Kill a Tiger follows Ranjit's uphill battle to find justice for his child. In India, where a rape is reported every 20 minutes and conviction rates are less than 30 percent, Ranjit's decision to support his daughter is virtually unheard of, and his journey unprecedented. His stand piques the interest of the Srijan Foundation, an NGO working to sensitize men and boys on women's rights. They look to Ranjit as a poster boy for their work and an inspiration to other men. Their support, along with the presence of the camera crew, fuels the ire of the villagers, and as the trial gets underway, threats of violence begin to loom. Ostracized by the community, dealing with mounting debt and fearing for himself and his family, Ranjit's composure begins to crack, and the whole process is in danger of being derailed. With tremendous access to all facets of the story, To Kill a Tiger charts the emotional journey of an ordinary man facing extraordinary circumstances. A father whose love for his daughter forces a social reckoning that will reverberate for years to come.",Documentary,['Documentary'],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

Anita,"Anita is a girl of only teenage years, and while she has developed early physically, to a mature woman, she is emotionally struggling. Her relationship with her parents and her friends is very poor and she is regarded with contempt by the people around her, even by the men who so ruthlessly use her. During her troubles she meets Erik, a young psychology student. Gently and carefully he begins to dispel her psychological blocks. In the course of this treatment she reveals to him some of the shocking episodes of her previous experiences. Erik believes he has the solution to Anita's problems: to let her move into an artist's communal experiment, of which he is already a member. The common interest of this collective is largely the performing of classical music. Anita's presence in the collective, however, is regarded by some of the other girls as highly provocative. Anita's nymphomania is her means of protest against her parents, school, society and her own environment (her whole life situation). He therefore tries to get her to see clearly, and with some insight, the breadth of her psychological situation. Against the background of the intensive battle that Anita carries on with the self-destructive drives within her, grows the depth of feeling that bind her and Erik together. She is no longer simply a ""case"" for him.

Meanwhile a young warrior, Camilan, braves the attacks of the Dragon and plans to marry his true love, the elf princess Larec.
